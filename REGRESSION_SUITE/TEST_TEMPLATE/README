To create a new TEST_XX in SFEMaNS follows the following steps:

Remark 1: $SFEMaNS_DIR should be define in your shell environment (in file .bashrc or other)
Remark 2: In the following, XX should be replaced by the number of your test
Remark 3: If you create a test that use restart, follow what is done for TEST_19_20

===Step1
cd $SFEMaNS_DIR/REGRESSION_SUITE/
cp -rf TEST_TEMPLATE TESTXX
cd TESTXX
cp ../../TEMPLATE/main.F90 LOCAL_SOURCES
cp ../../TEMPLATE/read_user_data.F90 LOCAL_SOURCES

===Step2
Open CMakeLists.txt and replace XX by number of new test (two instantiations)

==Step 3
Copy your condlim.F90 in LOCAL_SOURCES
Copy your data in REGRESSION_TESTS

===Step 4
Open REGRESSION_TESTS/job.sh

Uncomment following line
#cp current_regression_reference regression_reference_XX
and replace XX by number of new test (one instantiation)

===Step 5
Open the file
$SFEMaNS_DIR/CTEST_SUITE/CMakeList.txt
and add following line at the end of file (before the line enable testing)
add_subdirectory(${ROOT}/REGRESSION_SUITE/TESTXX ${ROOT}/REGRESSION_SUITE/TESTXX/BUILD)

(Do not forget to replace XX by your test number above, two instantiations)

===Step 6
run ctest (after recompiling) in $SFEMaNS_DIR/CTEST_SUITE/BUILD
You can use the following commands
cd $SFEMaNS_DIR/CTEST_SUITE/BUILD
cmake ..
make
ctest

===Step 7
cd $SFEMaNS_DIR/REGRESSION_SUITE/TESTXX
mv regression_reference_XX regression_reference

Open $SFEMaNS_DIR/REGRESSION_SUITE/TESTXX/REGRESSION_TESTS/job.sh
and comment the following line
cp current_regression_reference regression_reference_XX

===Step 8
Rerun ctest to make sure everything is ok.

===Step 9
Before commit/push changes, one needs to check that:
   1) condlim.F90 is indented corrected and has no whitespace at end of line
(use emacs and command M-x delete-trailing-whitespace)
   2) Compilation code with debug option does not create warning
(see condlim.F90 of TEST1 to remove warning due to unused variables)
